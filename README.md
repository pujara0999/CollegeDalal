# CollegeDalal
The project CollegeDalal is a platform where college students can buy or sell items such as coolers, lab coats etc which are generally required in college years. Thus, college students would be able to find such items directly on a website without buying it or asking every random colleague now and then. 


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

While studying in a college, students are generally asked to bring lab   coat for laboratories or steam tables in mechanical classes. Such items need to be bought or need to be asked from other colleagues randomly. Also, hostellers generally require coolers or pedestrian fans in summers which also needs to be bought from outside. Therein, there comes a need where college students can buy or sell such items on a common platform. This will reduce the efforts of searching for that item randomly.
